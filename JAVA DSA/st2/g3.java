/*
 * Write a program in Java to implement an integer array and perform following operations in form
of functions one after another in same sequence as mentioned:
(Applying, Evaluating)
1. Create an integer array having length of five (05) elements.
2. Input all five elements one after another.
3. Find maximum element from the input array.
4. Find minimum element from the input array.
5. Find Subtraction of all elements of the input array consecutively. Subtract first element
from second, second element from third and so on. Subtraction starts from index 0 to index
4.
a. Raise exception “Subtract is greater than equal to Zero”, if subtraction result is in
positive or zero.
b. Raise exception “Subtract is less than Zero”, if subtraction result is zero.
Input format:
Each line of the input contains array of five integers separated with a space.
Constraints:
Entered elements should be greater than 0 and lesser than 10
(1>= Arr[i] >= 9)
Output format:
Each line of the output contains the result
1. Maximum integer of input array,
2. Minimum integer of input array,
3. Subtract all integers in input array as discussed above,
a. If subtraction result is in zero or positive, then raise exception “Subtract is greater than
equal to Zero”, and
b. If subtraction result is in negative, then raise exception “Subtract is less than Zero”,
Sample Input:
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output:
5
1
-13
